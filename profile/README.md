## Project Overview 🌟🙋‍♀️

HealthNode is a decentralized application (Dapp) designed to revolutionize the healthcare industry. It empowers users to manage their hospital records, book doctor services from home, and engage in live consultations through a secure, decentralized platform. By leveraging blockchain technology and decentralized storage, HealthNode ensures privacy, accessibility, and efficiency in healthcare management.

## Key Features 🚀

### 1. Hospital Record Management 📋
- **Decentralized Record Storage**: Securely store complete medical history, diagnostic reports, and prescriptions on the blockchain.
- **Data Ownership**: Patients have full control over their medical records, granting or revoking access to healthcare professionals as needed.
- **Interoperability**: Easily share records across different healthcare institutions and professionals, enabling seamless transitions between providers.

### 2. Doctor's Services from Home 🏠👨‍⚕️
- **Home Consultation Requests**: Book consultations with doctors for at-home healthcare services, particularly beneficial for elderly, disabled, or remote patients.
- **Remote Diagnosis and Prescription**: Doctors can perform remote consultations and issue prescriptions, linked directly to the patient's medical records.
- **Payment Integration**: Seamless cryptocurrency payments for home services, ensuring transparency and convenience.

### 3. Live Consultations 🎥
- **Video Consultation Platform**: Secure, privacy-compliant video conferencing tool integrated for live doctor-patient consultations.
- **Consultation Records**: Automatic updating of consultation notes and outcomes in the patient's medical records.
- **Multi-specialty Support**: Access to a range of specialists including general practitioners, dermatologists, mental health professionals, and more.

### 4. Health Data Analytics for Patients 📊
- Provide data-driven insights into patients' health trends based on their historical medical data.

## Technology Stack 💻

1. **Blockchain**: Lisk for decentralized record storage and smart contract functionality.
2. **Smart Contracts**: Solidity-based smart contracts for managing record access control, payments, and service requests.
3. **Decentralized Storage**: IPFS or Arweave for secure storage of hospital records and consultation data.
4. **Frontend**: React/Next.js with web3.js or ethers.js for blockchain interactions.
5. **Video Conferencing API**: Integration with privacy-compliant third-party APIs (e.g., Zoom Health, Doxy.me) for live consultations.
6. **Wallet Integration**: Support for MetaMask, WalletConnect, or other crypto wallets to enable seamless payments.
